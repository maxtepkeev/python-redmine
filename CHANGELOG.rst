Changelog
---------

2.2.2 (2019-04-XX)
++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**:

- ResourceSet's ``export()`` method now supports ``columns`` keyword argument which can be either an iterable
  of column names or an "all" string which tells Python-Redmine to export all available columns

2.2.1 (2019-02-28)
++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**:

- ProjectMembership resource ``group`` attribute was returned as a dict instead of being converted to
  Resource object (`Issue #220 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/220>`__) (thanks
  to `Samuel Harmer <https://github.com/samuelharmer>`__)

2.2.0 (2019-01-13)
++++++++++++++++++

**Improvements**:

- ``PerformanceWarning`` will be issued when Python-Redmine does some unnecessary work under the hood to fix the
  clients code problems

**Changes**:

- *Backwards Incompatible:* Removed vendored Requests package and make it an external dependency as Requests did
  the same with it's own dependencies
- *Backwards Incompatible:* Removed Python 2.6 and 3.3 support as they're not supported by Requests anymore

**Bugfixes**:

- ``Redmine.upload()`` fails under certain circumstances when used with a file-like object and it contains unicode
  instead of bytes (`Issue #216 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/216>`__)
- ``Redmine.session()`` doesn't restore previous engine if fails (`Issue #211 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/
  python-redmine/issues/211>`__) (thanks to `Dmitry Logvinenko <https://github.com/dm-logv>`__)

2.1.1 (2018-05-02)
++++++++++++++++++

- Fix PyPI package

2.1.0 (2018-05-02)
++++++++++++++++++

This release concentrates mostly on stability and adds small features here and there. Some of them
are backwards incompatible and are marked as such. They shouldn't affect many users since most of
them were used internally by Python-Redmine. A support for the Files API has been finally added, but
please be sure to check it's documentation as the implementation on the Redmine side is horrible and
there are things to keep in mind while working with Files API. Lastly, only until the end of May 2018
there is a chance to buy a Pro Edition for only 14.99$ instead of the usual 24.99$, this is your
chance to get an edition with additional features for a good price and to support the further development
of Python-Redmine, more info `here <https://python-redmine.com/editions.html#pro-edition>`_.

**New Features**:

- Files API support (`Issue #117 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/117>`__)

**Improvements**:

- *Backwards Incompatible:* ResourceSet's ``filter()`` method became more advanced. It is now possible
  to filter on all available resource attributes, to follow resource relationships and apply lookups to
  the filters (see `docs <https://python-redmine.com/introduction.html#methods>`__ for details)
- ResourceManager class has been refactored:

  * ``manager_class`` attribute on the ``Resource`` class can now be used to assign a separate
    ``ResourceManager`` to a resource, that allows outsourcing a resource specific functionality to a
    separate manager class (see ``WikiPageManager`` as an example)
  * *Backwards Incompatible:* ``request()`` method has been removed
  * ``_construct_*_url()``, ``_prepare_*_request()``, ``_process_*_response()`` methods have been added
    for create, update and delete methods to allow a fine-grained control over these operations

- Ability to upload file-like objects (`Issue #186 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/
  186>`__) (thanks to `hjpotter92 <https://github.com/hjpotter92>`__)
- Support for retrieving project's time entry activities (see `docs <https://python-redmine.com/resources/
  project.html#get>`__ for details)
- Attachment ``update()`` operation support (requires Redmine >= 3.4.0)
- ``Resource.save()`` now accepts ``**attrs`` that need to be changed/set and returns ``self`` instead of a
  boolean ``True``, which makes it chainable, so you can now do something like ``project.save(name='foo',
  description='bar').export('txt', '/home/foo')``
- ``get`` operation support for News, Query, Enumeration, IssueStatus, Tracker, CustomField, ContactTag,
  DealStatus, DealCategory and CRMQuery resources
- ``include`` param in ``get``, ``all`` and ``filter`` operations now accepts lists and tuples instead of
  comma-separated string which is still accepted for backward compatibility reasons, i.e. one can use
  ``include=['foo', 'bar']`` instead of ``include='foo,bar'``
- It is now possible to use ``None`` and ``0`` in addition to ``''`` in ``assigned_to_id`` attribute in
  Issue resource if an assignee needs to be removed from an issue

**Changes**:

- *Backwards Incompatible:* Issue ``all`` operation now really returns all issues, i.e. both open and closed,
  instead of only returning open issues in previous versions due to the respect to Redmine's standard behaviour
- *Backwards Incompatible:* Instead of only returning a token string, ``upload()`` method was modified to return
  a dict that contains all the data for an upload returned from Redmine, i.e. id and token for Redmine >= 3.4.0,
  token only for Redmine < 3.4.0. Also it is now possible to use this token and pass it using a ``token`` key
  instead of the ``path`` key with path to the file in ``uploads`` parameter when doing an upload, this gives
  more control over the uploading process if needed
- *Backwards Incompatible:* Removed ``resource_paths`` argument from Redmine object since ``ResourceManager``
  now uses a special resource registry, to which, all resources that inherit from any Python-Redmine resource
  are being automatically added
- *Backwards Incompatible:* Removed ``container_many`` in favor of ``container_filter``, ``container_create``
  and ``container_update`` attributes on ``Resource`` object to allow more fine-grained resource setup
- *Backwards Incompatible:* ``return_raw`` parameter on ``engine.request()`` and ``engine.process_response()``
  methods has been removed in favor of ``return_raw_response`` attribute on engine object
- Updated bundled requests library to v2.15.1

**Bugfixes**:

- Support 204 status code when deleting a resource (`Issue #189 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/
  pull/189>`__) (thanks to `dotSlashLu <https://github.com/dotSlashLu>`__)
- Raise ``ValidationError`` instead of not helpful ``TypeError`` exception when trying to create a WikiPage
  resource that already exists (`Issue #182 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/182>`__)
- Enumeration, Version, Group and Notes ``custom_fields`` attribute was returned as a list of dicts instead
  of being converted to ``ResourceSet`` object
- Downloads were downloaded fully into memory instead of being streamed as needed
- ``ResourceRequirementsError`` exception was broken since v2.0.0
- RedmineUP CRM Contact and Deal resources export functionality didn't work
- RedmineUP CRM Contact and Deal resources sometimes weren't converted to Resource objects using Search API

**Documentation**:

- Mentioned support for ``generate_password`` and ``send_information`` in User's resource create/update
  methods, ``status`` in User's resource update method, ``parent_id`` in Issue's filter method and ``include``
  in Issue's all method

2.0.2 (2017-04-19)
++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**:

- Filter doesn't work when there are > 100 resources requested (`Issue #175 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/
  python-redmine/pull/175>`__) (thanks to `niwatolli3 <https://github.com/niwatolli3>`__)

2.0.1 (2017-04-10)
++++++++++++++++++

- Fix PyPI package

2.0.0 (2017-04-10)
++++++++++++++++++

This version brings a lot of new features and changes, some of them are backward-incompatible, so please
look carefully at the changelog below to find out what needs to be changed in your code to make it work
with this version. Also Python-Redmine now comes in 2 editions: Standard and Pro, please have a look at
this `document <https://python-redmine.com/editions.html>`__ for more details. Documentation was
also significantly rewritten, so it is recommended to reread it even if you are an experienced Python-Redmine
user.

**New Features**:

- RedmineUP `Checklist plugin <https://www.redmineup.com/pages/plugins/checklists>`__ support
- `Request Engines <https://python-redmine.com/advanced/request_engines.html>`__ support. It is
  now possible to create engines to define how requests to Redmine are made, e.g. synchronous (one by one)
  or asynchronous using threads or processes etc
- ``redmine.session()`` context manager which allows to temporary redefine engine's behaviour
- Search API support (`Issue #138 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/138>`__)
- Export functionality (`Issue #58 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/58>`__)
- REDMINE_USE_EXTERNAL_REQUESTS environmental variable for emergency cases which allows to use external
  requests instead of bundled one even if external requests version is lower than the bundled one
- Wrong HTTP protocol usage detector, e.g. one use HTTP when HTTPS should be used

**Improvements**:

- ResourceSet objects were completely rewritten:

  * ``ResourceSet`` object that was already sliced now supports reslicing
  * ``ResourceSet`` object's ``delete()``, ``update()``, ``filter()`` and ``get()`` methods have been
    optimized for speed
  * ``ResourceSet`` object's ``delete()`` and ``update()`` methods now call the corresponding Resource's
    ``pre_*()`` and ``post_*()`` methods
  * ``ResourceSet`` object's ``get()`` and ``filter()`` methods now supports non-integer id's, e.g.
    WikiPage's title can now be used with it
  * *Backwards Incompatible:* ``ValuesResourceSet`` class has been removed
  * *Backwards Incompatible:* ``ResourceSet.values()`` method now returns an iterable of dicts instead of
    ``ValuesResourceSet`` object
  * ``ResourceSet.values_list()`` method has been added which returns an iterable of tuples with Resource
    values or single values if flattened, i.e. ``flat=True``

- New ``Resource`` object methods:

  * ``delete()`` deletes current resource from Redmine
  * ``pre_delete()`` and ``post_delete()`` can be used to execute tasks that should be done before/after
    deleting the resource through ``delete()`` method
  * ``bulk_decode()``, ``bulk_encode()``, ``decode()`` and ``encode()`` which are used to translate
    attributes of the resource to/from Python/Redmine

- Attachment ``delete()`` method support (requires Redmine >= 3.3.0)
- RedmineUP CRM Note resource now provides ``type`` attribute which shows text representation of ``type_id``
- RedmineUP CRM DealStatus resource now provides ``status`` attribute which shows text representation of
  ``status_type``
- WikiPage resource now provides ``project_id`` attribute
- Unicode handling was significantly rewritten and shouldn't cause any more troubles
- ``UnknownError`` exception now contains ``status_code`` attribute which can be used to handle the
  exception instead of parsing code from exception's text
- Sync engine's speed improved to 8-12% depending on the amount of resources fetched

**Changes**:

- *Backwards Incompatible:* Renamed package name from ``redmine`` to ``redminelib``
- Resource class attributes that were previously tuples are now lists
- *Backwards Incompatible:* ``_Resource`` class renamed to ``Resource``
- *Backwards Incompatible:* ``Redmine.custom_resource_paths`` keyword argument renamed to ``resource_paths``
- *Backwards Incompatible:* ``Redmine.download()`` method now returns a `requests.Response
  <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/api/#requests.Response>`__ object directly instead of
  ``iter_content()`` method if a ``savepath`` param wasn't provided, this gives user even more control over
  response data
- *Backwards Incompatible:* ``Resource.refresh()`` now really refreshes itself instead of returning a new
  refreshed resource, to get the previous behaviour use ``itself`` param, e.g. ``Resource.refresh(itself=False)``
- *Backwards Incompatible:* Removed Python 3.2 support
- *Backwards Incompatible:* Removed ``container_filter``, ``container_create`` and ``container_update`` attributes
  on ``Resource`` object in favor of ``container_many`` attribute
- *Backwards Incompatible:* Removed ``Resource.translate_params()`` and ``ResourceManager.prepare_params()`` in
  favor of ``Resource.bulk_decode()``
- *Backwards Incompatible:* Removed ``is_unicode()``, ``is_string()`` and ``to_string()`` from
  ``redminelib.utilities``
- Updated bundled requests library to v2.13.0

**Bugfixes**:

- Infinite loop when uploading zero-length files (`Issue #152 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/
  issues/152>`__)
- Unsupported Redmine resource error while trying to use Python-Redmine without installation (`Issue #156
  <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/156>`__)

  (see `docs <https://python-redmine.com/resources/index.html>`__ for details)
- Added: ``total_count`` attribute to ResourceSet object which holds the total number
  of resources for the current resource type available in Redmine (thanks to
  `Andrei Avram <https://github.com/andreiavram>`__)
- Added: An ability to return ``None`` instead of raising a ``ResourceAttrError`` for all
  or selected resource objects via ``raise_attr_exception`` kwarg on Redmine object (see
  `docs <https://python-redmine.com/configuration.html#exception-control>`__ for
  details or `Issue #6 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/6>`__)
- Added: ``pre_create()``, ``post_create()``, ``pre_update()``, ``post_update()`` resource
  object methods which can be used to execute tasks that should be done before/after

- Fixed: Saving custom fields to Redmine didn't work in some situations
- Fixed: Issue's ``fixed_version`` attribute was retrieved as dict instead of Version resource
  object
- Fixed: Resource relations were requested from Redmine every time instead of caching the
  result after first request
- Fixed: `Issue #2 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/2>`__ (limit/offset
  as keyword arguments were broken)
- Fixed: `Issue #5 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/5>`__ (Version
  resource ``status`` attribute was converted to IssueStatus resource by mistake) (thanks
  to `Andrei Avram <https://github.com/andreiavram>`__)
