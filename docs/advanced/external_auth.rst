External Authentication
=======================

It is possible to use Python-Redmine as a provider for external authentication based on the
Redmine user database, e.g. imagine you are making a website and you want to only authenticate
your users if they provide the same login/password they use to login to Redmine:

.. code-block:: python

   username = 'john'    # username comes from the POST request on form submit
   password = 'qwerty'  # password comes from the POST request on form submit

   user = Redmine('https://redmine.url', username=username, password=password).auth()

If authentication succeeded, ``user`` variable will contain details about the current user, if
there was an error during authentication process, an ``AuthError`` exception will be thrown.

If you need more control, for example you want to return your own error message, you can
intercept ``AuthError`` exception and do what you need, for example:

.. code-block:: python

   from redminelib.exceptions import AuthError

   username = 'john'    # username comes from the POST request on form submit
   password = 'qwerty'  # password comes from the POST request on form submit

   try:
       user = Redmine('https://redmine.url', username=username, password=password).auth()
   except AuthError:
       raise Exception('Invalid login or password provided')
